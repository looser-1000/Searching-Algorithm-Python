## Binary Search:ðŸ’«
Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target value in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half:
Start with the middle element of the array.
If the middle element equals the target, return its position.
If the target is smaller, search the left half; if larger, search the right half.
Repeat until the target is found or the interval is empty.
The time complexity is O(log n), making it faster than linear search for large datasets.

```python
def binary_search(sequence, item):
    start_index = 0
    end_index = len(sequence) - 1

    while start_index <= end_index:
        mid_point = start_index + (end_index - start_index) // 2
        mid_point_value = sequence[mid_point]
        if mid_point_value == item:
            return mid_point
        elif item < mid_point:
            end_index = mid_point - 1
        else:
            start_index = mid_point + 1

    return None

sequence_a = [2,4,6,8,10,16,23,30,45]
item_a = 23
print("Item is present at index: ", binary_search(sequence_a,item_a))
```

## Linear Search:ðŸ’«
In Linear Search, we iterate over all the elements of the array and check if it the current element is equal to the target element. If we find any element to be equal to the target element, then return the index of the current element. Otherwise, if no element is equal to the target element, then return -1 as the element is not found. Linear search is also known as sequential search.

``` python
def linear_search(arr, n, item):
    for i in range(0,n):
        if arr[i] == item:
            return i
    return -1

array = [1,3,8,10,40,23,45,15]
target_item = 23
n = len(array)
result = linear_search(array,n, 23)
if result == -1:
    print("The target item is not present in the array")
else:
    print("The target item is present at index: ", linear_search(array, n, 23))
```
